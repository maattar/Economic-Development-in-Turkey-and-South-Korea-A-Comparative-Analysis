Replication files for "Economic Development in Turkey and South Korea: A Comparative Analysis"

1_Simple folder includes two data files (csv) and two programs (m) for the simple model, i.e., the Lucas (2009) benchmark. Run each m-file separately to generate Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively, for S. Korea and Turkey.

2_Extended folder includes the two data files and several m-files for the extended model. To generate Figures 4, 5, and 6, run the file called < run_benchmark.m >. Only after running this should one run < counterfactual_KOR.m > to generate Figure 7. 

3_Other folder includes two other data files (Maddison and PWT) for Figures 1 and 8. Run each m-file named accordingly to generate the figures.

4_HumanCapital folder includes the two data files and several m-files for the human capital model. To generate Figure 9 and 10, run the file < run_hc.m >. Then, to generate Figure 11, run < counterfactual_hc.m >. 

Please note that some figures need further editing before being saved as eps files.
